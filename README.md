# 📒 AddressBookApp

A **Spring Boot REST API application** for managing contacts in an Address Book.

This project demonstrates a **progressive implementation of Address Book features through 25 use cases**, covering REST APIs, file operations, database integration, multithreading, and external REST service communication.

The project follows a **Git Feature Branch Workflow**, where each feature is developed in a separate branch and later merged into the `dev` branch.

---

# 🚀 Features Implemented

The application supports:

- Creating and managing contacts
- REST API development using Spring Boot
- File storage operations (File IO, CSV, JSON)
- Database integration with MySQL using JDBC
- Multithreading for batch operations
- External API communication using JSON Server

# 🌐 REST API Endpoints

### Contact Management

```
GET /contacts
POST /contacts
PUT /contacts/{id}
DELETE /contacts/{id}
```

---

### Database APIs

```
GET /contacts/db
POST /contacts/db/add
PUT /contacts/db/update
GET /contacts/db/date-range
GET /contacts/db/count/city
GET /contacts/db/count/state
```

---

### JSON Server APIs

```
GET /contacts/jsonserver
POST /contacts/jsonserver/add-multiple
PUT /contacts/jsonserver/update/{id}
DELETE /contacts/jsonserver/delete/{id}
```

---

# 🐬 MySQL Database Setup

Create database:

```
CREATE DATABASE addressbook_db;
```

Create table:

```
CREATE TABLE contacts (
 id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
 first_name VARCHAR(50),
 last_name VARCHAR(50),
 address VARCHAR(100),
 city VARCHAR(50),
 state VARCHAR(50),
 zip VARCHAR(10),
 phone VARCHAR(15),
 email VARCHAR(100),
 date_added DATE
);
```

---

# 🌐 JSON Server Setup

Install JSON Server:

```
npm install -g json-server
```

Create a file:

```
db.json
```

Example:

```
{
  "contacts": []
}
```

Start server:

```
json-server --watch db.json --port 3000
```

Server URL:

```
http://localhost:3000/contacts
```

---

# 🧪 Testing APIs

You can test APIs using:

- **CURL**
- **Postman**
- **Browser (for GET requests)**

Example:

```
curl http://localhost:8080/contacts
```

---

# 🌿 Git Branch Strategy

The project follows a **Feature Branch Workflow**.

Main branches:

```
main
dev
```

Feature branches:

```
feature/UC1-create-contact
feature/UC2-add-contact
...
feature/UC25-delete-entry-jsonserver
```

Each use case is developed in a **separate branch and merged into `dev` after completion**.

# 🎯 Learning Outcomes

This project demonstrates:

- REST API development with Spring Boot
- Layered architecture (Controller → Service → DB/File)
- Database integration using JDBC
- File handling with CSV and JSON
- Multithreading in Java
- External API integration using RestTemplate
- Version control using Git feature branching
